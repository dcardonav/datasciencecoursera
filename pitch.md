Online Linear Regression
========================================================

The allows the user to select several variables to determine the impact they have over the fuel consumption of vehicles. 

The variables that can be used are:

- Number of Cylinders
- Transmission Type
- Number of Gears
- Weight
- Number of Carburators
- Gross Horsepower

Data
========================================================

The data comes from the mtcars dataset that's included with base R. Here's the description of the data according to the R Documentation

"The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models)."

Results: Coefficients and Significance Values
========================================================

The app shows the coefficients of the fitted model and the p-values so the user can determine if the variable has a statistically significant impact on the fuel consumption

```

Results: Plotting
========================================================

Also the app plots the fitted values produced by the model vs. the real data from the dataset; obviously the results depend on the variables the user chooses
